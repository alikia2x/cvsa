# About CVSA Project

CVSA (Chinese Vocal Synthesis Archive) aims to collect as much content as possible about the Chinese Vocal Synthesis
community in a highly automation-assisted way.&#x20;

Unlike existing projects such as [VocaDB](https://vocadb.net), CVSA collects and displays the following content in an
automated and manually edited way:

- Metadata of songs (name, duration, publisher, singer, etc.)
- Descriptive information of songs (content introduction, creation background, lyrics, etc.)
- Engagement data snapshots of songs, i.e. historical snapshots of their engagement data (including views, favorites,
  likes, etc.) on the [Bilibili](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilibili) website.
- Information about artists, albums, vocal synthesizers, and voicebanks.
