# About the CVSA Project

CVSA (Chinese Vocal Synthesis Archive) aims to collect as much content as possible about the Chinese Vocal Synthesis\
community in a highly automation-assisted way.

Unlike existing projects such as [VocaDB](https://vocadb.net), CVSA collects and displays the following content in an\
automated and manually edited way:

* Metadata of songs (name, duration, publisher, singer, etc.)
* Descriptive information of songs (content introduction, creation background, lyrics, etc.)
* Statistical data snapshots of songs, i.e. historical snapshots of their statistical data (including number views, favorites, likes, etc.) on the [bilibili](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilibili) website.
* Information about artists, albums, vocal synthesizers, and voicebanks.
